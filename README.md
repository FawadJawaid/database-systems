# Database Systems
This is a complete Database Systems project which is divided into three phases: 
- First one is **“ER Modeling”** 
- Second phase is **“Relational Model”** 
- Third phase is **“Schema Refinement”**

All the three phases are implemented for the three scenarios mentioned in the **DB-Assignment-1.pdf** file.
